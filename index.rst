Journeyman Python: Learning Python by reading code of well engineered software
==========================================================================================

The best way to learn any programing language and technique is to read other people's code.
What better way to learn that read through the code of some of the most well engineered open source Python libraries. In this book, we will read through selected code from Django, Flask and Pandas.
